A [[Disambiguation]] article is a special [[page]] that is created when some [[article|articles]] share the same name.

When a user searches something or clicks a [[link]], a page that shares a [[category]] will always take the priority.

However, when there is no article that shares a category, it will be left numerous options, without anything to help the decision.

In that case, a disambiguation article may take the priority, and guide people to choose the correct article.

However, authors still would have to try their best to prevent links connected to disambiguation articles by utilizing categories.
