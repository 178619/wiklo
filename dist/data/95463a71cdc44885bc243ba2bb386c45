[[Category]] is a special [[page]], and also a property one can have.

Any page can be marked as a category in edit.

When a page is in a category, it will always prioritize pages in the same category, when users search or click a [[link]].
* Users are more likely to find their desired [[article]] at once.
* Editing an article becomes easier and simpler.
* It allows pages to have the same title, without linking to [[disambiguation]] articles.
